 * Only put constants below if:
 *   - they are useful across web/extension/Nodejs environments, AND
 *   - the only other reasonable place to put them would be OUTSIDE of the /core folder
 *   - example: A Google query below would normally go in Google class, but that's outside of /core and we also need it on Android
 *
 * For any constants that are not expected to be reused that widely, just put them as private or public static props in relevant class.
