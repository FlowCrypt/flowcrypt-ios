# iOS UI tests with Appium

Before running tests, please download the app and move the app file into appium directory.

## Setup

1. You will need a secrets file at `appium/.env` - ask @tomholub to send it to you so that you can run tests locally.
2. `npm i`
3. `npm install -g appium@1.22.0`

## Run tests

`npm run ios.smoke` (all tests with tag #smoke will be included)

(todo - how to run all tests, how to run one test)
