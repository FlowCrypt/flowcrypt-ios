## üíª Development

We recommended developing and running tests using only the `Debug FlowCrypt` scheme.

## üñåÔ∏è Code Design

Please refer to our [Code Design README](./code-design.md) to learn how we handle errors and tasks.

## üîç UI Tests

Please refer to our [Appium README](./appium/README.md) for UI tests. It explains how to configure your environment, build the app, and write, run, or debug tests.

## üìö Dependency docs

- **UI**: We use [Texture](https://texturegroup.org/docs/getting-started.html) to improve the performance, memory efficiency, and thread safety of the app.
- **Storage**: We use [Realm](https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm/sdk/swift/realm-database/) as an alternative to SQLite.
- **IMAP/SMTP provider**: We use [MailCore](http://libmailcore.com/api/objc/index.html) which provides an asynchronous API to work with the e-mail protocols.
- **Icons**: We use [SF Symbols](https://developer.apple.com/sf-symbols/), a powerful resource for a vast collection of vector icons.

## üõ†Ô∏è Generating .ipa for penetration tester (Admin)

1\. Get the UUID of their device and input it into the [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/account/) account &#10140; **Devices**.
2\. Choose the right build (e.g. **FlowCrypt Enterprise**) and choose **Any iOS Device (arm64)**.
3\. **Xcode** &#10140; **Product** &#10140; **Archive**.
4\. **Distribute app** &#10140; **Add Hoc** &#10140; **Next** &#10140; **Next** (automatically manage signing).
5\. This creates a folder at the target where you export it, and the IPA will be there.
